Display your social media profile links with vector icons using a custom navigation menu.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a Widget that allows you to show show the social media links as vector icons.

To use it, follow these steps after activation:

1. Create a menu with links to your social media channels
2. Select “SVG Social Menu” as menu location and save it
3. Drag the widget “SVG Social Menu” in one of your widget areas

You can filter the custom CSS with the following code in your theme, where `$styles` is the CSS:

`function slug_edit_svg_social_menu_styles( $styles ) {
    $styles = '<style>yourStyles</style>';

    return $styles;
}

add_filter( 'svg_social_menu_inline_style', 'slug_edit_svg_social_menu_styles' );`

If you want to add CSS to the default rules, try this:

`function slug_edit_svg_social_menu_styles( $styles ) {
    $styles .= '<style>additionalStyles</style>';

    return $styles;
}

add_filter( 'svg_social_menu_inline_style', 'slug_edit_svg_social_menu_styles' );`
